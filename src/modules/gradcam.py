"""Grad-CAM faithfulness harness (T18 section 6.3).

Computes the module-agnostic Energy-Inside-Lung (EIL) metric at two taps:

- post-gate (``model.post_attn``): "where does the deployed model's
  evidence actually live?" -- the headline number.
- pre-gate (``model.backbone.features.norm5``): answers H3 -- "did the
  backbone's own representation change, or did the module just multiply a
  lung-shaped map onto unchanged features?" For arm A0 (no gate at all)
  both taps are the same layer, so EIL_post == EIL_pre there -- a useful
  self-check that the harness is wired correctly.

Requires `pip install grad-cam` (the `pytorch_grad_cam` package) -- already
used successfully on Kaggle by the Candidate C notebook
(notebooks/candidate-c-grad-cam-shortcut-suppression-loss.ipynb).

WARNING: the exact EIL definition (ReLU + min-max normalisation here) has
not yet been confirmed against Member 5's T30 definition (see WBS section
6.3) -- swap the normalisation in `_normalize_cam` if theirs differs.
Cross-candidate numbers must be computed with one shared definition.
