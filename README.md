## 📌 Overview

Chest X-ray (CXR) is the most common medical imaging exam in the world, and deep-learning models can now classify chest diseases with reported accuracies above 95%. **But high accuracy is often misleading.** A large body of research shows these models frequently succeed by exploiting hidden dataset artefacts — such as which hospital or scanner produced an image — rather than by reading the lungs. When such models are tested on data from a new hospital, their performance collapses. This is called **shortcut learning**, and it is the single biggest obstacle to deploying CXR AI in real clinics.

This project delivers a rigorous, reproducible comparison of four transfer-learning architectures — three CNNs (**ResNet50**, **DenseNet121**, **EfficientNet-B0**) and one Vision Transformer (**ViT-Base**) — evaluated under a single unified protocol. Crucially, models are ranked by **trustworthiness**, not accuracy alone, across **five axes**:

| Axis | Question it answers |
|------|--------------------|
| 🎯 **Accuracy** | Which model classifies best in-distribution? |
| 📏 **Calibration** | Does the model *know when it is uncertain*? |
| 🔍 **Explainability / Faithfulness** | Do explanations point at the diseased lung, or at artefacts? |
| 🛡️ **Robustness (OOD)** | Does it generalise to an unseen external dataset? |
| ⚡ **Efficiency** | Is it deployable (params, FLOPs, latency, memory)? |

> We do not propose a new architecture. **The contribution is the synthesis** — a unified benchmark across all five axes, using explainability as an *audit tool* to expose shortcut learning on the popular COVID-19 Radiography dataset.

## 🧭 Motivation & Research Gap

Our literature review (2023–2026) found that:

- **Plain CNN-vs-ViT accuracy comparisons are saturated** — dozens of recent papers already do this, and reviewers treat it as incremental.
- **Single-property studies exist in isolation** — separate papers on Grad-CAM, on calibration, on efficiency — but rarely together under one controlled protocol.
- **The popular mixed COVID-19 CXR datasets suffer from documented source bias** — because classes were collected from different hospitals, models learn the *source* instead of the *disease*. Internal AUCs above 0.99 have been shown to fall to ~0.76 on external data.

**The gap we exploit:** No existing study systematically compares CNNs and Vision Transformers across accuracy **+** calibration **+** explanation faithfulness **+** efficiency **+** cross-dataset robustness under one identical protocol — and even fewer use explainability to *quantify* shortcut learning. It is also unknown whether a Vision Transformer's global-attention bias makes it **more or less** prone to shortcut learning than convolutional models.

---

## ✨ Key Contributions

1. A **unified, open-source benchmark** comparing three CNNs and a Vision Transformer under identical preprocessing and training on chest X-rays.
2. The first **five-axis trustworthiness comparison** of these architectures (accuracy, calibration, explanation faithfulness, efficiency, cross-dataset robustness) together.
3. Use of explainability (**Grad-CAM / attention rollout / SHAP**) as a **quantitative audit for shortcut learning**, via a lung-localisation faithfulness score.
4. Evidence on whether **ViT's global attention** helps or hurts out-of-distribution robustness vs CNNs.
5. **Practical, reproducible deployment recommendations** depending on whether the priority is accuracy, trust, or compute budget.

## 🗂️ Datasets

| Dataset | Content | Role | Link |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| **COVID-19 Radiography Database** | 4 classes (COVID, Normal, Lung Opacity, Viral Pneumonia), ~21k images | **Primary** — train / val / test | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) |
| **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge** | ~26.7k frontal CXRs (DICOM) | **External** — out-of-distribution robustness test *(never trained on)* | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data) |
| *NIH ChestX-ray14* | >100k images, 14 labels | *Optional* generalisation check | *(if time permits)* |

> ⚠️ The primary dataset is known to contain **source bias** — which is precisely what this study investigates, rather than ignores.

## 🧠 Models

All four architectures load from [`timm`](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) with ImageNet-pretrained weights:

| Model | Family | ~Params | Role |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| **ResNet50** | CNN (residual) | 25.6 M | Stable universal baseline |
| **DenseNet121** | CNN (dense) | 8.0 M | Strong medical-imaging baseline |
| **EfficientNet-B0** | CNN (scaled) | 5.3 M | Smallest / fastest; deployment candidate |
| **ViT-Base/16** | Vision Transformer | 86 M | Global attention; CNN-vs-Transformer contrast |

```python
import timm
model = timm.create_model("vit_base_patch16_224", pretrained=True, num_classes=4)
```

> DeiT / ViT-Small are documented fallbacks if ViT-Base over-fits on the smaller dataset.

**Transfer-learning strategy (identical for every model):** Phase 1 — freeze backbone, train head. Phase 2 — unfreeze final blocks, fine-tune. Shared optimiser (AdamW), schedule, seed and augmentation, so any difference is attributable to the *architecture*, not tuning luck.

**Golden rule:** Freeze one identical preprocessing + training pipeline early and use it for every model. **Fair comparison is the entire point of the study.**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC (per-class + macro), confusion matrix
- **Calibration:** Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier score, reliability diagrams (pre/post temperature scaling)
- **Explainability:** heatmaps + a quantitative **lung-localisation faithfulness score** + cross-method agreement
- **Robustness:** internal-vs-external accuracy & AUROC drop (generalisation gap)
- **Efficiency:** parameters, FLOPs, model size, inference time (CPU/GPU), peak GPU memory
